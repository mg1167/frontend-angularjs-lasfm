# Learning AngularJS with LastFM
In this project you must use Github's public timeline to build a table of all events.
We will use the Last.FM api for this project. Go to http://www.last.fm/api to learn
how to use it.

To get up and running, you must:
1. Fork the project
2. clone it locally
3. install npm modules
```{shell}
sudo npm install
